Q: Explain what git clone does, in your own words

A: Git clone is used to make a copy of an existing git repository.

It is, in effect, a combination of several commands, which combine to make the following sequence

1) Make a local directory to put the repository into (mkdir <repository_name>)
2) start a git repository in this new directory (git init)
3) add a remote repository as a source (git remote add <name of repository> <url of repository>)
4) copy remote repository (git pull)
